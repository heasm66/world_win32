World is a text adventure game, like Adventure or Dungeon with a sci-fi
twist. It is supposedly quite portable. To create it, you must compile,
link, and run "vtxtcn.c" , then compile, link and run vcnvrt.c. Then
compile the other seven .c files and link them to make the World executable.
This program and q1text.dat are required to play the game.

A .bat file is provided - it is just "pseudocode".

Enjoy. Or be stumped. Or cheat.
